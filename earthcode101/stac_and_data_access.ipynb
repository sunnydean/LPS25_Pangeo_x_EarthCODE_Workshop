Examples include spatiotemporal data derived from imagery (from satellites, airplanes, and drones), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), point clouds (from LiDAR, structure from motion, etc.), data cubes, and full-motion video. The key is that the GeoJSON is not the actual 'thing', but instead references files and serves as an index to the STAC Assets.\n",

    "# STAC Components\n",
    "There are three component specifications that together make up the core SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog specification. These components are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Item - A STAC Item is the foundational building block of STAC. It is a GeoJSON feature supplemented with additional metadata that enables clients to traverse through catalogs. Since an item is a GeoJSON, it can be easily read by any modern GIS or geospatial library. One item can describe one or more SpatioTemporal Asset(s). For example, a common practice of using STAC for imagery is that each band in a scene is its own STAC Asset and there is one STAC Item to represent all the bands in a single scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Catalog - A Catalog is usually the starting point for navigating a STAC. A catalog.json file contains links to some combination of other STAC Catalogs, Collections, and/or Items. We can think of it like a directory tree on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Collection - A STAC Collection builds upon the STAC Catalog specification to include additional metadata about a set of items that exist as part of the collection. It extends the parent catalog by adding additional fields to enable the description of information like the spatial and temporal extent of the data, the license, keywords, providers, etc. Therefore, it can easily be extended for additional collection-level metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each component can be used alone, but they work best in concert with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "![stac](../static/stacsetup.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A STAC Item represents one or more spatiotemporal assets as GeoJSON so that it can be easily searched. The STAC Catalog specification provides structural elements to group STAC Items and Collections. STAC Collections are catalogs that add more required metadata and describe a group of related items. Now, let's dive into each one of these components a bit more in-depth.\n",

To search the STAC catalog to find collections of interest you will use the Collection Search API Extension. Depending on the level of metadata that has been provided in the STAC catalog you can search by the name of the collection and possibly by the variables – exposed via the Data Cube Extension.\n",
