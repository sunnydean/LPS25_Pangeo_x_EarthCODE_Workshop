    "This hands-on workshop is designed to introduce participants to EarthCODE's capabilities, guiding them from searching, finding, and accessing EO datasets and workflows to publishing reproducible experiments that can be shared with the wider scientific community. This workshop will equip you with the tools and knowledge to leverage EarthCODE for your own projects and contribute to the future of open science. During this 90 minute workshop, participants will, in a hands-on fashion, learn about: - Introduction to EarthCODE and the future of FAIR and Open Science in Earth Observation - Gain understanding in Finding, Accessing, Interoperability, and Reusability of data and workflows on EarthCODE - Creating reproducible experiments using EarthCODE’s platforms - with a hands-on example with Euro Data Cube and Pangeo - Publishing data and experiments to EarthCODE At the end of the workshop, we will take time for discussion and feedback on how to make EarthCODE better for the community.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Key Tools in Pangeo** that you will learn about today:\n",
    "- **Xarray**: Handles multi-dimensional labeled arrays (like NetCDF), with intuitive syntax that feels natural for Python users.\n",
    "- **STAC**: Simplifies discovery and access to large Earth observation datasets with a consistent, JSON-based catalog standard.\n",
    "- **Dask**: Enables parallel and distributed computing, scaling analysis from laptops to powerful cloud clusters.\n",
    "- **Zarr**: Provides efficient, cloud-native storage for chunked and compressed data, perfect for massive datasets.\n",
    "- **Jupyter**: Delivers an interactive, shareable environment for building and sharing workflows.\n",

    "We will be using the [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/) open-source software stack to demonstrate how to fetch EarthCODE published data and publically available satellite Sentinel-2 data to generate burn severity maps for the assessment of the areas affected by wildfires.\n",

    "We will use Sentinel-2 data accessed via [element84's STAC API](https://element84.com/earth-search/) endpoint and the [SeasFire Data Cube](https://opensciencedata.esa.int/products/seasfire-cube/collection) to find burned areas, inspect them in more detail and generate burn severity maps for the assessment of the areas affected by wildfires.\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate pangeo\n",
    "jupyter lab\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Open a web browser and connect to the Jupyterlab provided URL (you should see it in the jupyter lab command outputs), something like: http://localhost:8888/lab?token=42fac6733c6854578b981bca3abf5152.\n",

    "When dealing with large data files or collections, it's often impossible to load all the data you want to analyze into a single computer's RAM at once. This is a situation where the Pangeo ecosystem can help you a lot. Xarray offers the possibility to work lazily on data __chunks__, which means pieces of an entire dataset. By reading a dataset in __chunks__ we can process our data piece by piece on a single computer and even on a distributed computing cluster using Dask (Cloud or HPC for instance).\n",

The Client will also gather results from the Workers, and aggregate it back in its underlying Python process.\n",
