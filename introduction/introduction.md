# Introduction


# Welcome to the Pangeo x EarthCODE Workshop!

EarthCODE is a strategic initiative by the <b> European Space Agency (ESA) </b> designed to empower researchers in Earth System Science with FAIR and Open Science practices. By providing a collaborative development environment with integrated tools, cloud services, and expert guidance, EarthCODE helps scientists make their research more impactful, transparent, and reusable—while staying focused on the science itself.

<b>Doing Open Science shouldn't be hard, and EarthCODE makes it easy!</b>

This hands-on workshop is designed to introduce participants to EarthCODE's and the EDC Pangeo Platform's capabilities, guiding them from searching, finding, and accessing EO datasets and workflows to publishing reproducible experiments that can be shared with the wider scientific community.

This workshop will equip you with the tools and knowledge to leverage EarthCODE for your own projects and contribute to the future of open science. During this workshop, participants will, in a hands-on fashion will learn about the following:
- Introduction to EarthCODE and the future of FAIR and Open Science in Earth Observation
- Gain understanding in Finding, Accessing, Interoperability, and Reusability of data and workflows on EarthCODE
- Creating reproducible experiments using EarthCODE’s platforms - with a hands-on example with Euro Data Cube and Pangeo
- Publishing data and experiments to EarthCODE At the end of the workshop, we will take time for discussion and feedback on how to make EarthCODE better for the community.


**Pre-requirements for attendees**: The participants need to bring their laptop and have an active github account but do not need to install anything as the resources will be accessed online using Pangeo notebooks provided by EarthCODE and EDC.

Please register your interest by filling in this form: https://forms.office.com/e/jAB9YLjgY0 before the session.
