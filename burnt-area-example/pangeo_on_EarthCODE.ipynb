We explored a simple workflow with the [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/) open-source software stack, demonstrated how to fetch and access EarthCODE published data and publically available Sentinel-2 data to generate burn severity maps for the assessment of the areas affected by wildfires. Finally, we saved our work and learned about why FAIRness matters.\n",
